## Game Overview

In "Dragon Repeller," the player's objective is to defeat the dragon that is blocking the town's exit. The player starts in the town square and can navigate to different locations such as the store, the cave, or directly confront the dragon. Along the way, the player encounters various monsters that must be defeated to progress.

The game features the following mechanics:

- **Locations:** The game is divided into different locations such as the town square, store, cave, and dragon's lair. Each location has its own set of actions and challenges.

- **Combat:** Combat is turn-based, with the player and monsters taking turns to attack. The player can choose to attack, dodge, or run during combat.

- **Weapons:** The player can acquire different weapons throughout the game, each with its own damage potential. Weapons can be bought from the store or obtained by defeating monsters.
